# Changelog

All notable changes to goop are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

goop is pre-1.0: the command surface and on-disk formats may still
change between minor versions. Anything that would break an existing
install or lockfile is called out explicitly under **Changed**.

`goop version` reports the running build, including the commit it was
built from — quote it in bug reports.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [0.1.0] — unreleased

First release. goop installs and manages Windows applications from
Scoop buckets, reading the same manifests without requiring Scoop
itself.

### Added

**Packages** — `install`, `uninstall`, `update`, `list`, `info`,
`search`, `download`, `depends`, `hold`/`unhold`, `cleanup`, `reset`,
`cache`.

Installs are atomic: content is staged in a `<version>.partial`
directory and manifest hooks run against it before a single rename
commits the result, so a failed install leaves no trace. `hold` pins a
package against `update`; `cleanup` removes superseded versions;
`reset` rebuilds shims, shortcuts and environment entries for an
existing install.

**Scoop manifest compatibility** — a PowerShell prelude reimplements
the Scoop helper surface manifests call into (the `Expand-*` archive
helpers, `persist_data`, `Add-Path`, shim and shortcut creation), so
`pre_install`/`post_install` scripts written for Scoop run unmodified.
Zip and tar.gz are extracted natively in Go; other formats shell out to
7zip, innounp or dark, which are resolved as implicit dependencies and
installed automatically rather than assumed present on PATH.

**Buckets** — `bucket add/list/remove`, with per-bucket priority so a
name found in a preferred bucket wins over the same name in `main`.

**Shims** — commands are dispatched through hardlinks to a shim binary
paired with a text sidecar naming the real target.

**Profiles** — `profile`, `why`. Profiles group applications, and
membership acts as a safety net: removing something another profile
still needs requires `--force`.

**Reproducibility** — `lock`, `sync`, `status`, `import`. Lockfiles pin
version, URL and hash; `goop lock --file <path>` keeps one inside a
project repository rather than under the goop home. `sync` installs a
pinned entry straight from the frozen fields without consulting the
bucket, and `status` exits 3 on drift, for use in CI.

**Dependencies** — declared `depends` entries are resolved recursively
at install time, and uninstalling a package cascades to the packages
that declare it. The cascade deliberately follows only declared
dependencies, not the implicit extraction helpers: removing 7zip should
not remove everything that was once unpacked with it.

**Maven** — `maven-repo`, plus Maven coordinates installable as
first-class packages.

**Integrity and auth** — downloads are verified against the manifest
hash; `verify` checks minisign signatures; `auth` stores credentials
for private buckets in the Windows credential store.

**Other** — `config`, `migrate`, `completion` (PowerShell and bash,
with `--install` to register itself), and `version`.
